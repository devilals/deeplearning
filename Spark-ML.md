### What is MLlib?
MLLib is Apache Spark's scalable library for machine learning. It is available in multiple languages such as Java, Python, R etc.

Before going into details, it is important to note that there are two libraries available one is Spark MLlib and another is Spark ML.
The diefference between the two is in the use of data structure or data source APIs. The first one is RDD based APIs and the second one
is Dataframe based APIs. 

**Spark MLlib:**  The API built on top of RDDs. It is currently in maintenance mode i.e. only bug fixes but no new feature development.

**Spark ML:** API built on top of DataFrames for constructing ML pipelines. According to official documentation Spark ML is the primary machine
learning APIs currently.
