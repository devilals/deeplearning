TODO:
1. Blog-1: Machine Learning Interview
2. Blog-2: Solving Machine Learning Projects
3. Review and Feedback exercise of the ML course
4. Project Idea: 
  a) Using MNIST make a digit writing/learning system for kids. Kids draw the digit on the mobile screen and then the app tell whether it   is a correct digit and which digit. Also it can tell how much close the kid is to write that number -- 80% correctly written 8?
