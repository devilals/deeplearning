# Deep-Learning
Projects from Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity

The first week was an overview and for appreciating the algorithms there is reference to the style transfer algorithm. I tried the pre-trained algorithm and here are some results.


# Overfitting and Underfitting
When the training error is high and the test error is high --> Underfitting.

When the training error is low and the test error is high --> Overfitting

Q: What is Bias and Variance?
