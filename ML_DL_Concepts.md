# What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a field of study that enables computer programs to learn to do something. 
Unlike in traditional programs where the rules are coded for a program to make decisions or achieve something, in machine learning the program learns based on the data to take decisions or achieve something.


### What is Semisupervised Learning?
Semisupervised learning is based on partially labeled data. It is mostly a combination of supervised and unsupervised learnings.
Google photos tags a person in all photos available and it also tags another person in all those same photos available.
It groups a person in all photos - meaning it identifies that person A is in photos 1, 2, 4, 7 etc using unsupervised learning and it identifies that person A with his identity (name etc.) with supervised learning. Then all available photos where person A is present will be tagged with his name. This is an example of semisupervised learning.
